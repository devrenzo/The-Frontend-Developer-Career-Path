                        truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there
                        was too much.

                        didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                        I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my
                        place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a
                        bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
